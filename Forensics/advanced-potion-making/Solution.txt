1.) Download the file using wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/picoMini+by+redpwn/Forensics/advanced-potion-making/advanced-potion-making
2.) Run file advanced-potion-making
    got advanced-potion-making: data -> not much help
3.) run exiftool advanced-potion-making
    Didn't got any information from here also
4.) tried to run steghide extract -sf advanced-potion-making -p "Revelio"
    Didnt got any information from there too
5.) tried googling that which type file has a hexcode starting with 89 50, turns out it is a png file 
6.) So tried fixing the hexcode in hexedit as 89 50 4E 47 and 9.10,11,12 th bytes to 00 00 00 0D
    Now we have a fixed png file but its just a red color
7.) maybe some filter is applied so we tried to edit the file in the online editor https://www.online-image-editor.com/
    on Changing colour to black and white we are able to see the flag
