1.) Download the .pcapng file and open it in wireshark
2.) Check for conversations that happend during the capture, there are only 2
3.) Applying 1st one as filter we can see that there is a file instruction.txt, we export them and we get plan, pictures and instruction.txt
4.) On opening instruction.txt we can see -> GSGCQBRFAGRAPELCGBHEGENSSVPFBJRZHFGQVFTHVFRBHESYNTGENAFSRE.SVTHERBHGNJNLGBUVQRGURSYNTNAQVJVYYPURPXONPXSBEGURCYNA
5.) The above could be a flag we can apply base64 decode or ROT13 decode, on ROT13 decode we get the text
    TFTP DOESNT ENCRYPT OUR TRAFFIC SO WE MUST DISGUISE OUR FLAG TRANSFER. FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HIDE THE FLAG AND I WILL CHECK BACK FOR THE PLAN
6.) So we now check our flag file and get -> VHFRQGURCEBTENZNAQUVQVGJVGU-QHRQVYVTRAPR.PURPXBHGGURCUBGBF
    I USED THE PROGRAM AND HID IT WITH-DUEDILIGENCE. CHECK OUT THE PHOTOS
7.) I ran exiftool picture3.bmp on all 3 images picture2 is unoridirarily large with 37 MB maybe we have some embedde file in this image.
8.) Ran binwalk -e picture2.bmp but nothing got nothing.
9.) We also have a program.deb in our files that we exported from wireshark
10.) Ran sudo apt-get install ./program.deb and got info as follows:
        Note, selecting 'steghide' instead of './program.deb'
11.) Searched for steghide on chatGPT and got the following info
        Steghide is a steganography tool that allows you to hide data within various types of image and audio files.
        The primary purpose of steganography is to conceal the existence of data within other non-suspicious files.
        Steghide supports a variety of file formats for both the cover files and the embedded data
12.) Ran command steghide extract -sf photo.jpg -p mypassword -> steghide extract -sf picture3.bmp -p "DUEDILIGENCE" and got the flag.txt file -> cat flag.txt

flag -> picoCTF{h1dd3n_1n_pLa1n_51GHT_18375919}
