We will be using binwalk application for this problem
    Binwalk is a powerful tool used for analyzing and reverse engineering binary files. It is particularly useful for extracting firmware images,
    identifying embedded file systems, and locating specific data within a binary file. Binwalk is widely used in the field of firmware analysis,
     cybersecurity, and reverse engineering

Solution
Hint 1 -> I searched for "Wait, you can hide files inside files? But how do you find them?" on chatGPT and found out that binwalk could be used for solving this problem

1.) Downloaded the image
2.) Use exiftool to analyze the image but not enough information
3.) Used strings dolls.jpg | grep 'picoCtf' but got nothing
4.) Checked for 'man binwalk' and got info as follows
    binwalk  - tool for searching binary images for embedded files and exe‚Äê
       cutable code
5.) So we need to search for embedded files as our fist hint also indicates
6.) We can use -e option in our binwalk command to extract any embedded file
7.) After running binwalk --run-as=root -e dolls.jpg command I got _dolls.jpg.extracted
8.) After running cd _dolls.jpg.extracted/base_images we have a new image 2_c.jpg
9.) Now we will do point 7 and 8 till we get something of interest inside 2_c.jpg
10.) Inside the 4_c.jpg image we get a file called flag.txt
11.) After runnign cat flag.txt we get our flag
